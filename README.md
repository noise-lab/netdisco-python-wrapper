# Python Wrapper for NetDisco

Wrapper optimized for PyInstaller, so that anyone can run [NetDisco](https://github.com/home-assistant/netdisco.git) as a standalone binary (without having to rely on Python 3 and a number of Python packages).

This wrapper is used by the [Princeton IoT Inspector](https://iot-inspector.princeton.edu/) project.
